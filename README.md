# ItemTemplateResetHelp

I have this set of Radio buttons created via an ItemTemplate. I want to reset which radio button is currently selected when I click the button. Please help me understand where in the MVVM architecture the information about which radio button is currently selected is hidden when I use an ItemTemplate. And how to remove said selection.

The NuGet CommunityToolkit.Mvvm is installed
